# Creator multimedia needs → remaining ffkit gaps


Researched 2026-09-22 against **ffkit 0.27.0** (`main` + round-2 branch). Same-day research base as the 0.26.0/0.27.0 rounds below — refreshed priorities only, no new sources needed. This note is not a restatement of landed work — the tail lists what not to redo.


## What 2026 creators still trip on

**Platform size limits are the recurring hard wall.** Agents can edit and export, but "fit under N" is still hand-math:

- Discord free tier is **10 MB** now (nitro 500 MB); WhatsApp video caps ~**16 MB**; email attachments ~**20–25 MB**. Creators keep hitting "file too large" *after* finishing an edit.
- ffmpeg has no `--size` flag: the fix is bitrate math — `video_kbps = (target_bits × 0.98 − audio_bits) / duration` — then **two-pass** to actually land the size ([ffmpeg-cookbook, Apr 2026](https://ffmpeg-cookbook.com/en/articles/two-pass-encoding/); [bitrate math walkthrough, Jul 2026](https://dev.to/alexpua/how-i-make-ffmpeg-hit-an-exact-file-size-the-bitrate-math-nobody-explains-3o7o)). Agents reinvent this per job and overshoot.

**Podcast→clips is the #1 scaled workflow.** [Loopdesk, Jul 2026](https://loopdesk.ai/blog/video-workflows-for-creators): the four workflows that cover almost every creator are podcast-to-clips, weekly YouTube, archive mining, multi-platform publishing. Audio-only episodes need a **picture** before they can be a Reel/Short — the standard artifact is a cover still with an animated waveform (**audiogram**). ffmpeg `showwaves` renders it without any extra dependency.

**Audio cleanup comes before loudness.** [MSY Editor, Mar 2026](https://msyeditor.com/ai-video-editing-workflow-2026/): in every AI edit pipeline, noise reduction is applied *first*, before levels and B-roll — room rumble, laptop fan, hiss. Homebrew/apt ffmpeg ships `afwtdn`, `highpass`, `afftdn`; no model files needed.


**Multi-source audio is the other half of "my audio is bad".** Creators record on the camera AND a lav mic; "swap in the clean track" is a daily ask. `music` mixes a bed *under* the original; nothing *replaces* it. Raw `-map 0:v -map 1:a` is simple but error-prone (sync offset, length mismatch, codec copy of an incompatible container).



**Photo montages are the second-largest audio-only adjacent case.** "Turn these 12 photos into a 30-second Reel with music" is the classic slideshow ask: normalize stills onto a canvas, crossfade, lay a bed that ends cleanly. Doable in raw ffmpeg (`-loop 1 -t` + xfade chain) but the offset math (`k*(per-fade)`) is exactly the kind of thing agents get wrong.



**Landscape→vertical repurpose wants a blurred fill, not black bars.** The repurpose playbooks (CuteDyno Jun 2026, loopdesk multi-platform) assume a blurred pillarbox when the source is 16:9 — black `pad` bars read as unedited. `split + scale=increase,crop + gblur + overlay=centered fg` is a known-graph but error-prone raw.



**HDR iPhone footage washed out in SDR feeds** needs `zscale`+`tonemap`; Homebrew ffmpeg here has `tonemap` but **no `zscale`** (needs `--with-libzimg`). Gate behind `doctor` before promising it.

## Gaps vs ffkit 0.27.0

|| Creator request | Today | Gap |
||-----------------|-------|-----|
|| Swap camera audio for lav mic / new voice / new music | `music` mixes a bed under; nothing replaces | Raw `ffmpeg -map` only — landed this run as `replace` |
|| Photo dump → montage video ("把照片做成视频") | nothing builds video from stills | Landed this run as `slideshow` |
|| "套我的 LUT / film look" | `grade` sliders only | Landed this run as `grade --lut` (`lut3d`) |
|| Word-group "karaoke" captions (chunked, no ASR) | whole-cue raster burn | Landed this run as `caption --chunk N` (approximation — true word highlight still needs a timing source) |
|| Transition variety on montage | `slideshow`/`concat` fade only | Landed this run as `slideshow --transition` + `--motion kenburns` |
|| "Keep room tone under the lav" | `replace` drops the original | Landed this run as `replace --mix G` |
|| HDR→SDR for iPhone clips | — | needs libzimg (`zscale` absent on Homebrew/apt) |


## Ordered directions (this run)


1. **`caption --chunk N`** — split each burn cue into ≤N-word sub-cues that share its span (`start + i*span/k`). Chunked captions are the dominant 2026 social look; honest approximation of karaoke without an ASR/timing source. `--chunk 1` is word-by-word.
2. **`slideshow --transition` + `--motion kenburns`** — the static fade-only montage reads flat vs CapCut/etc: wire the xfade flavors (`wipe*`, `slide*`, `dissolve`, `radial`, `circleopen`) and per-still zoompan drift (even push-in, odd pull-out) on a filled canvas (`scale=increase,crop` — no bars inside the zoom window).
3. **`replace --mix G`** — "keep a little room tone under the lav": `[0:a]volume=G × [1:a]amix` instead of full replacement.


Next (not this run): true word-highlight karaoke (needs a word-timed source — whisper export or `align`; none in repo), HDR→SDR (needs libzimg — absent on Homebrew/apt), `concat --transition` variety (same xfade list), Ken Burns on `concat`/`broll` inserts.


## Already landed (do not redo)


Deliver 1080×1920 −14 LUFS; caption burn without libass + `--safe social` bottom-20%; broll cutaway keeps A-roll audio/duration and plays B from its first frame; rough-cut speech islands (list, then encode only keeps); music duck (aformat dbl pin for sidechaincompress on apt ffmpeg); speed; jumpcut; cover; fade; title; loop; stabilize; reverse; grade/zoom/sharpen/vignette/bw/volume/blur; pipeline `$src`/`$in`/`expect`; GitHub Release zips; English + Chinese README; **0.26.0**: `denoise` (afwtdn/afftdn fallback), `compress --size` two-pass budget, `fit`/`broll --fit blur`, `audiogram`. **0.27.0**: `replace`, `slideshow`, `grade --lut`. **0.28.0**: `caption --chunk`, `slideshow --transition`/`--motion kenburns`, `replace --mix`.
